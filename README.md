# Social Proof Section
This is a simple HTML/CSS webpage that displays a social proof section with testimonials from satisfied customers. 

## The webpage includes the following files:

- index.html: This is the HTML file that contains the structure and content of the social proof section. It includes HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and divs to structure the content.

- style.css: This is the CSS file that contains the styling rules for the social proof section. It includes CSS properties such as font-size, color, margin, padding, and display to control the appearance and layout of the content.

- reset.css: This is a CSS file that resets the default styles of HTML elements to ensure consistent styling across different browsers.

- images/: This directory contains image files used in the webpage, such as profile pictures and star icons.

## The social proof section includes the following components:

- statement: This div contains a heading and a paragraph that provide an introduction to the section.

- rating: This div contains three sub-divs (rating-1, rating-2, and rating-3) that display ratings and reviews from different sources.

- testimonials: This div contains three cards (card1, card2, and card3) that display testimonials from satisfied customers. Each card includes a profile picture, name, and comment.

- The webpage uses Google Fonts to apply the "League Spartan" font family for headings and paragraphs. It also uses custom CSS styles to control the layout, spacing, and color of the content.

- Note: The webpage is currently in English and uses the "en" language attribute in the HTML tag. If needed, you can update the language attribute to display the content in a different language.
